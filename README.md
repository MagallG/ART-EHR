# ART-EHR
Electronic Health Records build, primarily starting with the database schema build and then the GUI with 
funtionality will be put in there in (Either with python or Java, well have to wait and see what the gods have to say about that.

Check out the WIKI for more detailed description.

Code used (or to be used in this case)
+ SQL Server
+ Kivy
+ Python

If you see any good in it, feel free to fork the hell out of it...would make me please to know I added some value to the world.

**UPDATE**
So I uploaded what ever files i had of the GUI that was created in Kivy. Important to note is i had originally wanted to do this in
Tkinter, but functioality was limited. I guess thats why it took me so long to get this done (Its been like 5 years of on and off). 
Kivy is back breaking and antagonizing, thank God for AI, because most (approximately all) of the Kivy code and debugging was done in 
ChapGPT, Gemini and the Microsoft thing.

This maybe the last update ill ever put out here, 
**I need to say that i am not a developer of any sort, I just wanted my baby to come to life.**
I Do loads of SQL however and I am currently stressing myself out with DAX... couldnt someone have written easier syntax?
